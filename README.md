📚 **Services:**

<ul>
<li><b>S3:</b> Amazon S3 is an object storage service that provides manufacturing scalability, data availability, security, and performance.
<li><b>IAM (Users, Groups & Role):</b> This is nothing but identity and access management which enables us to manage access to AWS services and resources securely.
<li><b>QuickSight:</b> Amazon QuickSight is a scalable, serverless, embeddable, machine learning-powered business intelligence (BI) service built for the cloud.
<li><b>Glue (Crawler, Studio & Glue Catlog):</b> A serverless data integration service that makes it easy to discover, prepare, and combine data for analytics, machine learning, and application development.
<li><b>Lambda:</b> Lambda is a computing service that allows programmers to run code without creating or managing servers.
<li><b>Athena:</b> Athena is an interactive query service for S3 in which there is no need to load data it stays in S3.
<li><b>SNS:</b> A distributed publish/subscribe solution used for application-to-application (A2A) and application-to-person (A2P) communication. SNS topics are used to enable communication: producers publish messages to topics, and consumers subscribe to these topics to receive messages. You can deliver messages to various types of subscribers, such as AWS SQS queues, AWS Lambda functions, and HTTP endpoints. You can also use SNS to send SMS messages, email, and push notifications to end-user devices.
<li><b>Cloudwatch & Logs:</b> It enables you to monitor your complete stack (applications, infrastructure, network, and services) and use alarms, logs, and events data to take automated actions and reduce mean time to resolution (MTTR). This frees up important resources and allows you to focus on building applications and business value.

This module is split into two major components:

**▶️ Part 1: Automated YouTube Data Extraction, Cleaning & Insightful Visual Analytics**

⇢ Using the YouTube Data API, the pipeline scrapes topic-specific content (e.g., Data Science) and captures rich metadata::
<ul>
<li> <b> Channel-level attributes: </b>
Channel Name, Subscribers, Total Views, Video Count, Playlist ID
<li> <b> Video-level attributes: </b>
Title, Description, Video ID, Publish Date, Likes, Dislikes, Views, Comments
<li> After data collection, extensive data wrangling + preprocessing operations are performed, followed by univariate, bivariate, and multivariate EDA using interactive charts and visualizations.
<li> This part essentially turns raw YouTube metadata into clean, structured insights—ready for downstream NLP tasks.
</ul>

#
