## Youtube ðŸ“º Data Mining & Analysis ðŸ“ˆ End-End Data Engineering & Data Science Project

### Dataset Overview:
For this Project I have used 2 Types of Data as mentioned below:

1.) Trending YouTube Video Statistics which is taken from Kaggle

Data Link: Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/youtube-new
.csv File - Each regionâ€™s data is in a separate file. Data includes the video title, channel title, publish time, tags, views, likes and dislikes, description, and comment count.
Json File - Is in Key - Value format, where for each Region it has 30 nested K-V Pairs which includes the id as a Primary Key and Channel_id & Category Name where the videos are categorised into different Categories like: Film & Animations, Sports, Science & Technology, Entertainment, Music & Many More etc. 

2.) Youtube data is scrapped by using Youtube Data Api according to search word entered by the user, for our case i have used ' Data Science '
